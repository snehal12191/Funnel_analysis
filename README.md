#Funnel Analysis 
A funnel analysis is a method of understanding the steps required to reach an outcome on a 
website and how many users get through each of those steps. The set of steps is referred to as a 
“funnel” because the typical shape visualizing the flow of users is similar to a funnel in your

As data analysis based on SQL queries has been used to get aggregated files. Code is 
mentioned in the appendix section. It's important to note that while aggregated 
datasets offer performance benefits, they might not be suitable for all types of analysis.

raw data depends on the specific use case and the level of detail needed for analysis 
and decision-making.
